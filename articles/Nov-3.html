<h1 id="Intro%20to%20Linux">Intro to Linux</h1>

<p>Linux is a computer operating system (OS). Windows and MacOS are also OSes. However, Linux is different than those OSes in numerous ways. It&#39;s insufficient to simply say that Linux is an OS, as there is much more to say about it.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example of what a Linux desktop could look like.</p>

<p><img src="../img/linux-mint.png" alt="Linux desktop image 1" /></p>

<p>However, it doesn&#39;t have to look like that. You could make it look like this:</p>

<p><img src="../img/rice1.jpg" alt="Linux desktop image 2" /></p>

<p>Or even this!:</p>

<p><img src="../img/terminal.jpg" alt="Linux desktop image 3" /></p>

<p>Don&#39;t feel intimidated by the terminal (it&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t even know what this is!), or anything else that I mention here. We will walk through all of this in much more detail later. This is just an intro! Think of this as a teaser trailer of the real thing.</p>
