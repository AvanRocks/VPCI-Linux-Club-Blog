<h1 id="Command%20Line%20Basics">Command Line Basics</h1>

<p>The CLI, or <strong>Command Line Interface</strong> is a text-based way to do stuff on your Linux computer. (Back in the old days, this was actually the <em>only</em> way to interact with the computer).</p>

<h2 id="Terminology">Terminology</h2>

<ul>
<li>directory = folder</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Filesystem%20hierarchy">Filesystem hierarchy</h2>

<ul>
<li>All files in Linux are arranged in a hierarchical directory structure</li>
<li>a directory can hold 2 things:

<ol start="1">
<li>Files</li>
<li>Other directories</li>
</ol></li>
<li>the topmost directory (or outermost folder) is &#8216;&#47;&#8217; and is called the root directory</li>
<li>inside the root directory, there are many directories (most of them, you don&#39;t need to worry about). One of them is called &#8216;home&#8217;

<ul>
<li>inside &#8216;home&#8217;, each user has their own &#8216;home directory&#8217; named after their username. All your personal files are in your home directory</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If there&#39;s a directory or file inside another directory, then you can append its name to the parent directory to get its full path name

<ul>
<li>for ex. bob&#39;s home directory would be called &#47;home&#47;bob</li>
<li>another example: &#47;home&#47;bob&#47;Documents&#47;school&#47;math&#47;homework.pdf</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Note: if you append a slash (&#47;) to a <strong>directory</strong> name, it doesn&#39;t change the meaning (it doesn&#39;t matter). This is not the case for files, however.</p>

<h2 id="Terminal">Terminal</h2>

<ul>
<li>the &#8216;Terminal&#8217; is a program that allows you to use the CLI</li>
<li>open with Ctrl-Alt-T or search for &#8216;Terminal&#8217; in the applications menu</li>
<li>When using the terminal, you can think of the terminal as being &#8216;in&#8217; a directory at all times</li>
<li>You interact with the computer by typing &#8216;commands&#8217; and then pressing Enter</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Commands">Commands</h1>

<h2 id="1.%20pwd%20-%20print%20working%20directory">1. pwd - print working directory</h2>

<ul>
<li>outputs the &#8216;current&#8217; directory, or in other words, the directory that the terminal is &#8216;in&#8217; currently</li>
<li>you can see the same information written in blue text on the terminal</li>
<li>a tilde (~) is short for your home directory (which is &#47;home&#47;bob, but replacing bob with your username)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2.%20ls%20-%20list">2. ls - list</h2>

<ul>
<li>lists all files and directories in the current directory</li>
<li>shows you what you would normally see in a graphical file browser</li>
<li>type <code>ls -a</code> to show all files, including hidden files. Hidden files are those that start with a dot (.).</li>
<li>In general, you can replace the &#8216;a&#8217; with other letters to modify the effect of a command. These are known as &#8216;options&#8217;. 

<ul>
<li>For example, you can use the &#8216;l&#8217; option with the <code>ls</code> command (type <code>ls -l</code>) to see some more info about the files and directories (don&#39;t worry about what it means) </li>
<li>Other commands have options too</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3.%20cd%20&amp;#60;name&amp;#62;%20-%20change%20directory">3. cd &#60;name&#62; - change directory</h2>

<ul>
<li>change the current directory. Replace &#60;name&#62; with the name of the directory that you wish to enter. Equivalent to clicking on a folder in a graphical file browser</li>
<li>type <code>cd ..</code> to go to the parent directory</li>
<li>you can chain multiple directories like so:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>cd Documents&#47;notes&#47;
</code></pre>

<p>You can even chain &#8216;..&#8217;, like this: </p>

<pre><code>cd ..&#47;..&#47;..&#47;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>you can use &#8216;absolute&#8217; and &#8216;relative&#8217; path names of the directories

<ul>
<li>absolute names start with &#8216;&#47;&#8217;. for ex. &#47;home&#47;bob&#47;Documents&#47;english</li>
<li>relative names don&#39;t start with &#8216;&#47;&#8217; and are assumed to begin from the current directory. for ex. Documents&#47;english</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4.%20man%20&amp;#60;command&amp;#62;%20-%20manual">4. man &#60;command&#62; - manual</h2>

<ul>
<li>shows you information about the usage of a command</li>
<li>replace &#60;command&#62; with a command, like &#8216;ls&#8217; or &#8216;cd&#8217;</li>
<li>press q to quit</li>
<li>although the &#8216;man pages&#8217; (which is the common name for these manual entries) may seem hard to understand at first, I encourage you to at least try to read the Description section. Over time, you will learn the jargon and the man pages will become more and more helpful.</li>
<li>man pages also list all the commands&#8217; options, and what each option does</li>
</ul>
