<p>Before we get started installing Linux onto our computer, there are some things we need to take care of. I will explain these things in this blog post. In the next post, I will walk you through the process of actually installing it.</p>

<p>We will be installing Ubuntu Linux, which is a &#8216;distribution&#8217; of Linux that is suitable for beginners. In case you don&#39;t know what a distribution is, it&#39;s simply a convenient package of Linux along with some commonly used software. There are several different distributions (or &#8216;distros&#8217; as they are commonly called) that include software for different uses. For now, we will use Ubuntu.</p>

<p>See <a href="../topics/Installing-Linux-1.html">this page</a> for the detailed instructions.</p>
