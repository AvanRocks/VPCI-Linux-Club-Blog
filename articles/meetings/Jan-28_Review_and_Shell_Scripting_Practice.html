<h1 id="Jan%2028th:%20Review%20and%20Shell%20Scripting%20Practice">Jan 28th: Review and Shell Scripting Practice</h1>

<p>Today, we reviewed concepts already taught in previous lessons.</p>

<p>We also discussed real-world applications of shell scripting and we went over some of my own scripts to learn how they work. Unfortunately, I cannot provide a written version of that discussion. If you missed today&#39;s lesson and really want to know about it, let me know in a future meeting and I will show you.</p>
