<h1 id="Feb%204th:%20CLI%20Challenge">Feb 4th: CLI Challenge</h1>

<p>Today we practiced our CLI skills using <a href="https://cmdchallenge.com/">this website</a> to solve some fun problems using bash commands.</p>

<p>Try to do the first 10 or so problems.</p>

<p>While solving the problems, first try to recollect the commands you learned (and their options!) and think of creative ways to apply that knowledge. If you are still stuck, use the <code>man</code> command to check the manual page of the relavant command. If, however, you are <em>still</em> stuck, refer to our earlier blog posts for ideas. Finally, if you still  can&#39;t solve it, after having given it your best, check the solutions in the dropdown menu above the problem on that website. There will be many solutions that solve the problem. All of them work, but usually, the shorter and simpler the solution, the better it is.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, like &#8220;Why does this solution work?&#8221;, send me an email (or just google it :) ).</p>
